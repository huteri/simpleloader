# Presentation Layer

The reason why I chose architecture component, because

1. easy to test like MVP
2. lifecycle safety like MVVM (lifecycle aware)
3. supported by Google, which means, google engineers help you to build better app, how awesome is that. (think about the latest saved state to handle configuration changed)
4. simple and easy to use with livedata not like RxJava

# Data Layer
RxJava is still the best for this in my opinion, with many operators to do data manipulation and also threading.
